## 👋 About Me

I’m **Amr AL_Alwani**, a third-year Cybersecurity student, focusing on **web application penetration testing** and **vulnerability analysis**.  
I’m actively improving my skills through hands-on platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, and I believe in practical, real-world training over theoretical knowledge.  
I’m continuously pursuing self-development and specialization in offensive and defensive security environments.
